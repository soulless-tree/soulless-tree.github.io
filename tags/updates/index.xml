			<description>&lt;p&gt;It took some time, but after the release of this really helpful &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Hugo Actually Explained (Websites, Themes, Layouts, and Intro to Scripting)&#34;&gt;Luke Smith&amp;rsquo;s tutorial on Hugo&lt;/a&gt; I was finally able to port my old site to this framework. I must say that, although most of the process was an easy rewriting of what I already had, the seemingly simple navigation bar was by far the most laborious thing to make. First, because I had to figure out how to add non-section Markdown files (the Home and About sections) to the Section Menu for Lazy Bloggers, which later I learned had to be added manually in the config file as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[menu]
[[menu.main]]
name = &#39;Home&#39;
url = &#39;/&#39;

[[menu.main]]
name = &#39;About&#39;
url = &#39;/about&#39;
&lt;/pre&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The second reason was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t mantain the highlighting of the selected menu item within section posts, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/another-way-to-make-a-menu-item-active/17029&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; title=&#34;Another way to make a menu item active&#34;&gt;luckily I found a solution&lt;/a&gt;. And now that everything is working properly I can finally look foward to implement some kind of interactive gallery to the Art section (maybe this is the time to learn JavaScript).&lt;/p&gt;
