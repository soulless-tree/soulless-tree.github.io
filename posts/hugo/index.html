		<p>It took some time, but after the release of this really helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I" target="_blank" title="Hugo Actually Explained (Websites, Themes, Layouts, and Intro to Scripting)">Luke Smith&rsquo;s tutorial on Hugo</a> I was finally able to port my old site to this framework. I must say that, although most of the process was an easy rewriting of what I already had, the seemingly simple navigation bar was by far the most laborious thing to make. First, because I had to figure out how to add non-section Markdown files (the Home and About sections) to the Section Menu for Lazy Bloggers, which later I learned had to be added manually in the config file as follows:</p>
<pre>
[menu]
[[menu.main]]
name = 'Home'
url = '/'

[[menu.main]]
name = 'About'
url = '/about'
</pre> 
<p>The second reason was that I couldn&rsquo;t mantain the highlighting of the selected menu item within section posts, but <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/another-way-to-make-a-menu-item-active/17029" target="_blank" title="Another way to make a menu item active">luckily I found a solution</a>. And now that everything is working properly I can finally look foward to implement some kind of interactive gallery to the Art section (maybe this is the time to learn JavaScript).</p>
